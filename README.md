### FRONTEND

**Responsible for creating User Interface**

We should have 2 screens like below

**Techstack**

I was considering betwee the 3 frontend frameworks/librarys that I have experience: ReactJS, VueJS or Flutter. Then I chose the most famous one which is ReactJS so we can go with MERN techstacks

### BACKEND

I will use NodeJS as a web server, ExpressJS as a web framework so we can easy create routing API and create a fullstack JavaScript system with MERN. Our sytem needs to communicate in real time so it's time to pick up Socket.io

### DATABASE

I will go with MongoDB as a non-SQL, cross flatform and document-oriented database which is easy to scale, high performance for a real time app.

**So in this project, we will take advantages of the MERN techstacks: MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS**
